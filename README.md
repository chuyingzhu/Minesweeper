# Minesweeper
This is an Android app that I created in May 2018. It contains a standard 10x10 game board with 10 mines randomly placed and hidden.
## Rules
The goal of this game is to mark (or "flag") all the mines. Numerical clues are given when you tap a cell that does not contain a mine; it indicates the number of mines in adjacent cells. You lose immediately when you tap a cell that contains a mine.
